The "Quiet Space" project is an intuitive Android mobile app that helps users quickly locate quiet spaces nearby, based on their needs (work, study, or relaxation). The app leverages geolocation data, filterable categories (cafes, libraries, coworking spaces), and reservation recording to deliver a convenient and personalized experience.
